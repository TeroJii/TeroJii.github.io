    "text": "Hi there, and welcome to my blog!\nI used to write a blog years ago, when I was living abroad, and I quite liked it. After a long hiatus, I thought that it might be nice to give it a try once more.\nThis blog is intended mostly for myself, to help me clarify my thoughts around data science related topics. I have found that writing is a very helpful aid in learning things. If someone else also finds the topics interesting/useful, then that is a great bonus.\nWelcome aboard. Let’s see what lies ahead."

    "text": "This website is built with Quarto, which is an open-source publishing system. It can be used for making reports, books, presentations, websites etc. I wanted to learn how to use Quarto for making a website, so I decided to make one for myself. In this blog post I’ll go trough some the basics which are needed for creating a simple website."
