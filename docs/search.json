    "text": "Two y-axes\nOne place to look for inspiration regarding plots is The R Graph Gallery. This wonderful website also has an example for creating a plot with a dual y-axis. Let’s walk through the process with our storm data. We’ll start by looking at the data we plan to plot.\n\nmod_storms %>% \n  select(date_hour, wind, pressure) %>% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  date_hour            wind pressure\n  <dttm>              <int>    <int>\n1 1975-06-27 00:00:00    25     1013\n2 1975-06-27 06:00:00    25     1013\n3 1975-06-27 12:00:00    25     1013\n4 1975-06-27 18:00:00    25     1013\n5 1975-06-28 00:00:00    25     1012\n6 1975-06-28 06:00:00    25     1012\n\n\nWe can see that there is quite a difference in the magnitude of the numeric values for wind and pressure. The approach for creating a secondary y-axis is somewhat artificial, and what we actually need to do is to scale one of the y-axis columns to have a similar range with the other column. Let’s start by finding the maximum values for wind and pressure.\n\nmax_wind <- max(mod_storms$wind)\n\nmax_pressure <- max(mod_storms$pressure)\n\n# scale wind values\nmod_storms2 <- mod_storms %>% \n  select(date_hour, wind, pressure) %>% \n  mutate(scaled_wind1 = wind/max_wind,\n         scaled_wind2 = max_pressure*wind/max_wind, .after = wind)\n\nhead(mod_storms2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  date_hour            wind scaled_wind1 scaled_wind2 pressure\n  <dttm>              <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>    <int>\n1 1975-06-27 00:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n2 1975-06-27 06:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n3 1975-06-27 12:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n4 1975-06-27 18:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n5 1975-06-28 00:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1012\n6 1975-06-28 06:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1012\n\n\nNow we have scaled the wind values to have a maximum value of 1 and also to have the same largest value as the pressure values. We could have also scaled the pressure values as well. The choice was arbitrary. Now we can see that the values can be easily plotted on the same scale.\n\n# plot wind and pressure\nmod_storms2  %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"scaled_wind2\", \"pressure\"), names_to = \"phenomenon\", values_to = \"measurement\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_hour, y = measurement, lty = phenomenon)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Measurement value\")\n\n\n\n\nChanges in wind speed and air pressure during the Amy storm. Wind speed values have been scaled to match the maximum air pressure values.\n\n\n\n\nBoth lines are now sharing the same y-axis. Now all we need to do is to show the wind speed values on the secondary y-axis. However, there is one improvement we can do while we are at it. In the plot above, the wind speed values have been scaled to match the maximum value of air pressure. We can see that for this particular data this is not a great choice, as the relative changes in the data are so different for the two phenomena. We can fix this by changing the scaling so that the range of wind speed values matches the range of air pressure values.\nThe secondary y-axis can be introduced by using the sec_axis() function. We need to do an inverse scaling for the y-label values to display the original wind speeds.\n\n# rescale wind data between min and max of pressure\nmin_pressure <- min(mod_storms$pressure)\nmin_wind <- min(mod_storms$wind)\n\n# scale wind values\nmod_storms2 <- mod_storms %>% \n  select(date_hour, wind, pressure) %>% \n  mutate(scaled_wind1 = (wind - min_wind)/(max_wind  - min_wind),\n         scaled_wind2 = (max_pressure - min_pressure) * scaled_wind1 + min_pressure, .after = wind)\n\n\nmod_storms2  %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date_hour)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = pressure)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y =  scaled_wind2), lty = 2, color = \"red\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    # Features of the first axis\n    name = \"Pressure (mbar)\",\n    # Add a second axis and specify its features\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(\n        # inverse transformation of scaled wind speeds for secondary y-axis\n      ~ (. - min_pressure)*(max_wind - min_wind)/(max_pressure - min_pressure) + min_wind, \n      name = \"Wind speed (knots)\"\n      )\n  ) +\n  labs(x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nChanges in wind speed (red dashed line) and air pressure (black solid line) during the Amy storm. Wind speed values have been scaled to match the air pressure value range. The labels for the secondary y-axis have undergone inverse scaling to show the unchanged wind speed values.\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see both lines plotted in the same graph, and we have an individual y-axis to show independent values and units for the two phenomena. This makes it easy to compare the lines."

    "text": "Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, UMAP for short, is a method which can be used to reduce the number of dimensions in a data set. Dimensionality reduction methods can be very useful when you are dealing with a large number of features, and can help mitigate issues such as multicollinearity. Personally I like to use them during exploratory data analysis. The umap package provides means for using UMAP with R.

    "text": "Dimensionality reduction via PCA\nThere are many packages for performing PCA in R. For example, the {stats} package has the prcomp function. Let’s use it, and visualize the first two principal components.\n\n# Perform PCA\npca.out <- prcomp(swiss, scale. = TRUE)\n\n# record names of municipalities into a tibble\nmunicipalities <- row.names(pca.out$x) %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  rename(municipality = value)\n\n# visualize first two principal components\npca.out$x %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  bind_cols(municipalities) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = municipality)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_y = -0.1) +\n  ggtitle(\"PCA output\")\n\n\n\n\nThe first two principal components of the swiss data.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above we can see which municipalities share similarities based on the data. That being said, this example is somewhat artificial, and does not make much sense beyond testing PCA output. In a more pragmatic setting, we might be interested, for example, if some numeric features help us to classify the observations into different classes. Here, we might want to know if the other numeric indicators in the data are connected to e.g. Fertility.\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram of fertility values in the swiss data.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s define 70 as the limit of high fertility and label municipalities above this threshold as High. This choice divides the observations into two approximately equal sized groups, but other than that is completely arbitrary. Let’s re-try PCA with the remaining numeric columns.\n\n# modified data with fertility classes\nswiss_mod <- swiss %>% \n  mutate(fert_class = if_else(Fertility > 70, true = \"High\", false = \"Low\")) %>% \n  select(-Fertility)\n\n# PCA without the Fertility column\npca_mod <- prcomp(select(swiss_mod, -fert_class), scale. = TRUE)\n\n# visualize first two principal components for the modified data\npca_mod$x %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  bind_cols(municipalities) %>% \n  bind_cols(select(swiss_mod, fert_class)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = municipality, color = fert_class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_y = -0.1) +\n  ggtitle(\"PCA output\", subtitle = \"Fertility divided into two classes\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(n = 3, \"Pastel1\")) +\n  labs(color = \"Fertility:\")\n\n\n\n\nThe first two principal components of the modified swiss data. Municipalities are marked as having High fertility if the numeric value exceeds 70.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the numeric columns provide some degree of separation between the high and low fertility municipalities."

Let’s test this by running the calculations again with a different seed.\n\nset.seed(345)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-calculated UMAP components with a different random seed.\n\n\n\n\nWe notice that the output is quite similar, but still slightly different.

Let’s see what happens when we change the default number of components and nearest neighbors.\n\n# re-calculate UMAP for the data\numap.out <- umap(select(swiss_mod, -fert_class),\n                 n_components = 4, \n                 random_state = 333,\n                 n_neighbors = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-calculated first and second UMAP components with a different random seed, more components and smaller number of nearest neighbors.\n\n\n\n\nNow the output resembles more the one we got by using PCA. The original article on UMAP goes into finer detail with regards to the effects of hyperparameter tuning, but we can certainly see that we can tune the output significantly."
