After a long hiatus, I thought that it might be nice to give it a try once more.\nThis blog is intended mostly for myself, to help me clarify my thoughts around data science related topics. I have found that writing is a very helpful aid in learning things. If someone else also finds the topics interesting/useful, then that is a great bonus.\nWelcome aboard. Let’s see what lies ahead."

However, this seems to happen rarely enough, that I end up frantically googling for advice. Now, creating that secondary y-axis ain’t exactly rocket science, but anyone who has been using ggplot2 will tell you that it is not trivial either. To save myself the trouble of having to look for advice in the future, I will show how it can be done with a few simple steps."

    "text": "Re-organizing the plot via faceting\nLet’s re-plot the data by using two y-axes. The easiest way to do this with ggplot2 is by using faceting.\n\n# plot wind and pressure\nmod_storms  %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"wind\", \"pressure\"), names_to = \"phenomenon\", values_to = \"measurement\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_hour, y = measurement, lty = phenomenon)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_grid(phenomenon ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Measurement value\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\nWind and air pressure changes for the Amy storm divided into two different plots.\n\n\n\n\nThe data is now faceted into two separate panes. This let’s us scale the y-axes independently, which already makes it easier to see that wind speeds are going up as the pressure is dropping. What we are still missing though, are the units on the y-axis. Let’s create one more iteration of this plot."

    "text": "Two y-axes\nOne place to look for inspiration regarding plots is The R Graph Gallery. This wonderful website also has an example for creating a plot with a dual y-axis. Let’s walk through the process with our storm data. We’ll start by looking at the data we plan to plot.\n\nmod_storms %>% \n  select(date_hour, wind, pressure) %>% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  date_hour            wind pressure\n  <dttm>              <int>    <int>\n1 1975-06-27 00:00:00    25     1013\n2 1975-06-27 06:00:00    25     1013\n3 1975-06-27 12:00:00    25     1013\n4 1975-06-27 18:00:00    25     1013\n5 1975-06-28 00:00:00    25     1012\n6 1975-06-28 06:00:00    25     1012\n\n\nWe can see that there is quite a difference in the magnitude of the numeric values for wind and pressure. The approach for creating a secondary y-axis is somewhat artificial, and what we actually need to do is to scale one of the y-axis columns to have a similar range with the other column. Let’s start by finding the maximum values for wind and pressure.\n\nmax_wind <- max(mod_storms$wind)\n\nmax_pressure <- max(mod_storms$pressure)\n\n# scale wind values\nmod_storms2 <- mod_storms %>% \n  select(date_hour, wind, pressure) %>% \n  mutate(scaled_wind1 = wind/max_wind,\n         scaled_wind2 = max_pressure*wind/max_wind, .after = wind)\n\nhead(mod_storms2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  date_hour            wind scaled_wind1 scaled_wind2 pressure\n  <dttm>              <int>        <dbl>        <dbl>    <int>\n1 1975-06-27 00:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n2 1975-06-27 06:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n3 1975-06-27 12:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n4 1975-06-27 18:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1013\n5 1975-06-28 00:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1012\n6 1975-06-28 06:00:00    25        0.417         422.     1012\n\n\nNow we have scaled the wind values to have a maximum value of 1 and also to have the same largest value as the pressure values. We could have also scaled the pressure values as well. The choice was arbitrary. Now we can see that the values can be easily plotted on the same scale.\n\n# plot wind and pressure\nmod_storms2  %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"scaled_wind2\", \"pressure\"), names_to = \"phenomenon\", values_to = \"measurement\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_hour, y = measurement, lty = phenomenon)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Measurement value\")\n\n\n\n\nChanges in wind speed and air pressure during the Amy storm. Wind speed values have been scaled to match the maximum air pressure values.\n\n\n\n\nBoth lines are now sharing the same y-axis. Now all we need to do is to show the wind speed values on the secondary y-axis. However, there is one improvement we can do while we are at it. In the plot above, the wind speed values have been scaled to match the maximum value of air pressure. We can see that for this particular data this is not a great choice, as the relative changes in the data are so different for the two phenomena. We can fix this by changing the scaling so that the range of wind speed values matches the range of air pressure values.\nThe secondary y-axis can be introduced by using the sec_axis() function. We need to do an inverse scaling for the y-label values to display the original wind speeds.\n\n# rescale wind data between min and max of pressure\nmin_pressure <- min(mod_storms$pressure)\nmin_wind <- min(mod_storms$wind)\n\n# scale wind values\nmod_storms2 <- mod_storms %>% \n  select(date_hour, wind, pressure) %>% \n  mutate(scaled_wind1 = (wind - min_wind)/(max_wind  - min_wind),\n         scaled_wind2 = (max_pressure - min_pressure) * scaled_wind1 + min_pressure, .after = wind)\n\n\nmod_storms2  %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = date_hour)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = pressure)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y =  scaled_wind2), lty = 2, color = \"red\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    # Features of the first axis\n    name = \"Pressure (mbar)\",\n    # Add a second axis and specify its features\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(\n        # inverse transformation of scaled wind speeds for secondary y-axis\n      ~ (. - min_pressure)*(max_wind - min_wind)/(max_pressure - min_pressure) + min_wind, \n      name = \"Wind speed (knots)\"\n      )\n  ) +\n  labs(x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nChanges in wind speed (red dashed line) and air pressure (black solid line) during the Amy storm. Wind speed values have been scaled to match the air pressure value range. The labels for the secondary y-axis have undergone inverse scaling to show the unchanged wind speed values.\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see both lines plotted in the same graph, and we have an individual y-axis to show independent values and units for the two phenomena. This makes it easy to compare the lines."
