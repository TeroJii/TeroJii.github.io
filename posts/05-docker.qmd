[Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) are a great way to provide an interactive user interface for exploring data, running models or simulations, and much more. However, writing a Shiny app on your local computer is one thing, but providing it to a customer or colleague in a scalable way requires something more. Enter [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

What is Docker? Docker provides a way to run your Shiny app inside something called a *container*, which is basically a virtual environment ([read more here](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)). This allows you to share your app via Cloud providers such as AWS and Azure. You can also run the containers on a local machine, without needing to worry about R installations etc.

Sounds great. Let's see what is needed for setting your Shiny app to run inside a container.

## Installing Docker

The installation depends on your operating system, but the installation should be easy enough for Mac OS, Windows, and Linux as well. [The website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) has detailed instructions to guide you through the process.

### Installation for Windows

For Windows you will basically need an application called Docker Desktop. The requirements needed for running this application are listed [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). For Windows versions 10/11, you will basically need to install WSL 2 to run docker. Look at the link above for detailed instructions.

Joe Torres has a blog post detailing the steps needed for using Azure App service to [host your Shiny app](https://joetorres531.medium.com/build-an-enterprise-ready-r-shiny-app-with-azure-and-docker-a87c73028d97).
