Hi there, and welcome to my blog!

I used to write a blog years ago, when I was living abroad, and I quite liked it. After a long hiatus, I thought that it might be nice to give it a try once more.

This blog is intended mostly for myself, to help me clarify my thoughts around data science related topics. I have found that writing is a very helpful aid in learning things. If someone else also finds the topics interesting/useful, then that is a great bonus.

Welcome aboard. Let's see what lies ahead.
